## Why Bufrnix?

Protocol Buffer tooling has traditionally suffered from **dependency hell**, **network dependencies**, and **non-reproducible builds**. While Buf's remote plugin system simplifies initial setup, it introduces critical limitations that become deal-breakers for production teams:

**Remote Plugin Limitations:**

- **Network dependency** breaks offline development and corporate environments
- **64KB response limits** cause silent failures with large generated outputs
- **Security concerns** from sending proprietary schemas to external servers
- **Technical constraints** prevent file system access and cross-plugin dependencies
- **Ecosystem bottlenecks** limit available plugins to centrally-approved options

**Bufrnix solves these challenges** with local, deterministic execution powered by Nix.

  <Card title="Offline-First Development" icon="laptop">
    Never worry about network connectivity again. All plugins execute locally
    with dependencies managed by Nix. Work anywhere - corporate firewalls,
    air-gapped environments, or your favorite coffee shop.
  </Card>
  <Card title="True Reproducibility" icon="rocket">
    Same inputs = identical outputs, always. Cryptographic hashes ensure supply
    chain integrity. No more "works on my machine" problems or surprise build
    breakages from remote infrastructure changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security & Compliance" icon="shield">
    Keep proprietary schemas internal. All processing happens on your machines -
    sensitive API definitions never leave your environment. Perfect for
    financial services, healthcare, and government contractors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance Excellence" icon="lightning">
    Up to 60x faster builds compared to remote plugins. No artificial size
    limits, network latency, or rate limiting. Support for custom plugins,
    multi-stage generation, and complex workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-language Support" icon="puzzle">
    Generate code for 8+ languages simultaneously: Go, Dart,
    JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Python, Swift, C/C++, and more. Full plugin
    ecosystem with gRPC, Connect, validation, and custom protocols.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Setup DevEx" icon="open-book">
    `nix develop` provides complete toolchain in seconds. Type-safe
    configuration catches errors before generation runs. Complete tooling
    including CLI, linter, formatter, and LSP support.

### When to Choose Bufrnix

**Choose Bufrnix if you need:**

- Offline development capabilities
- Corporate firewall/air-gapped environment support
- Sensitive schema privacy and compliance
- Custom or community plugins not in Buf's registry
- Reproducible builds with version pinning
- High-performance local execution
- Multi-language code generation workflows

**Buf's remote plugins work well for:**

- Quick experimentation and getting started
- Simple, single-language projects
- Teams comfortable with external processing
- Workflows fitting within remote plugin limitations

Bufrnix doesn't replace Buf - it **extends** the Protocol Buffer ecosystem with local, reproducible alternatives for teams that need them.

## The Hybrid Approach

Many teams adopt a **complementary strategy** that maximizes the benefits of both tools:

1. **Use Buf for** schema management, breaking change detection, and collaborative development with the buf.build registry
2. **Use Bufrnix for** actual code generation in production environments where control, performance, and compliance matter
3. **Combine both** for comprehensive Protocol Buffer development workflows

This pattern addresses the full spectrum of protobuf development needs - from experimentation to production deployment.

## Technical Advantages

**üîß No Artificial Limits**

- Remove the 64KB response size constraint that breaks large outputs
- Support plugins requiring file system access and cross-plugin dependencies
- Enable directory-based generation strategies for optimal performance

**üèóÔ∏è Supply Chain Security**

- Cryptographic verification of all dependencies through Nix's content-addressed storage
- Local execution eliminates external attack vectors
- Full audit trail of plugin versions and their provenance

**‚ö° Advanced Workflows**

- Multi-stage generation where plugins build on previous outputs
- Parallel execution across multiple languages and plugin chains
- Custom plugin development without subscription requirements

## Get Started

Add Bufrnix to your Nix flake and start generating Protocol Buffer code right away:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    bufrnix.url = "github:conneroisu/bufrnix";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, bufrnix, ... }: {
    # Your configuration here
  };
}
```
