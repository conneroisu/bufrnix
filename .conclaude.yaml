# Commands to run during Stop hook
# Each line is executed as a separate bash command
stop:
  run: |
    sh ./test-examples.sh

# Validation rules for hook processing
rules:
  # Prevent Claude from creating or modifying files at the repository root
  # Helps maintain clean project structure

  # - "*.md" - file extensions  
  # - "src/**/*.ts" - nested patterns
  # - ".env*" - environment files
  # - "docs/**" - entire directories
